# Castille Assesment

## Task 1 Description
Develop an authenticated Order Taking API stack that is exposed to 3rd party endpoints (example an
ERP system) selling products on behalf of Melita.
An order specifies the player details (including personal details, installation address, preferred
installation date + time slot details), the required products (e.g. Internet, TV, Telephony, Mobile) and
the required package per product (e.g. Internet 250Mbps or 1Gbps, TV with 90 Channels or 140
Channels, Telephony with Free On net Calls or Unlimited Calls, Mobile Prepaid or Mobile Postpaid). The Order Taking API must validate these details and accept the order. On accepting the
order it must publish a messaging event to a RabbitMQ topic for Melita's Ordering Fulfilment system
and Care systems to pick it up:-

* Deliverables.

1) An authenticated public REST based Order Taking API stack.
2) Micro services to be implemented using Spring Boot
3) Publish events to a RabbitMQ
4) Code needs to be version controlled in a Git Repo
5) Expect very good code design and robust error handling, design and integration patterns


## Software Specifications

      "product_id": 1,
      "product_package_id": 5,
      "installation_time": "2022-09-01T19:38:30.904Z",
      "installation_address": "Kisumu, Kenya"
    }
        
```

## Storage
**Task 1**
1. For Storage I am using H2- database which is an in-memory database and saving to file for persistence

H2 DB UI: http://localhost:8080/h2-console
```
jdbcUrl:jdbc:h2:file:/data/orderdb
username :sa
password :password
```
**Task 2**
1. MYSQLDB- for persistence

Find sample in the project resource.
credentials are located in config-datastore on github, link shared on email

## Assumptions
1. **Product Object is overloaded with packages, during fetching of a Product the response comes with its associated packages. This can be changed by commenting the below line in product model entity**
```
productDto.setProductPackages(this.packages.stream().map(ProductPackage::toProductPackageDto).collect(Collectors.toList()));
```
2. **Creation of system users was beyond scope of the project hence configuring password and usernames to authenticate endpoints. For an advanced system this can be its own microservice and we can implement using JWT and Oauth 2.0**


3. **Orders are made by customers but product and packages are set by agents hence order creation endpoint has security for user while the rest are administrator protected**
