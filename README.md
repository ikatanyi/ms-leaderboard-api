# Real Time Leaderboard System

## Task 1 Description
Create a real-time leaderboard system for a multiplayer online game. The system should be able to handle the following operations efficiently:

* Deliverables.
1) Add a new player's score.
2) Update an existing player's score.
3) Retrieve the top 'N' players.
4) Retrieve a playerâ€™s rank in the leaderboard


## Software Specifications
    * java 1.8
    * Maven
    * Springboot V2.5
    * MYSQL Database
    * RabbitMQ
    * Redis 7.2.0

## Assumptions
    1) Players and scores are diffent entities hence they exist in a one-to-one relationship
    2) Players data are rarely retrieved hence we can easily work on score data without actually putting strain on the db fetching player data
